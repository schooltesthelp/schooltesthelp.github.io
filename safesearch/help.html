<h2>404</h2>

  The address you entered was not found. Make sure that the url is working and spelled correctly. Do not add "http://" to the beginning of the website as well.

<br>
<h2>DANGER!!</h2>
<p>
  The address is not secure, and can not be shown on SafeSearch.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Website loading forever or example.com will not connect.</h2>
<p>
  The address put a x-frame content header. We bypass this using a proxy. The proxy might of been expired. Click the menu >>> Re-enable proxy. Then click get temporary access to server. Reload the page, and try again. If you do not see the button, refresh SafeSearch and try again.
